TITTLE: fourth one-page project (a project for ambitious people from Kodilla).

TECHNOLOGIES USED: html5, css3, rwd, jQuery, flexbox.

DESCRIPTION: This project is different from other ones because it has a border round
the text. I did it by using pseudoelements ::before and ::after. For the small
devices I had to delete these pseudoelements because the borders collided with
the headers. Clicking on the button or pictures redirects user to Google.
